## WHY (describing the purpose)
Bart is a biscuit fiend. He constantly craves biscuits of all varieties; and lives purely for the joyous crunch of Anzac cookies (his favorite). He has always wondered if others also share his powerful lust for baked treats; and wishes to find other like minded biscuit fanciers to compare, rate and review the cornucopia that is the modern biscuit market. He wishes to enflame the passions of others through an active communicative community sharing advice, pictures and, of course, biscuits.


## WHAT (describing your site)
Our site will allow users to browse information about biscuits that have been added by users. The biscuits will have various properties such as rating, reviews, name, brand, calories, pictures etc. The user can add new biscuits as well as rate/review existing biscuit entries. The home page will show a selection of the top rated biscuits. The user will also be able to utilise filters whilst browsing the entire library of biscuits.
